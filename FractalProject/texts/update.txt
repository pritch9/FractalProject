UPDATE:

How to update the escape distance of the fractal.


On the JMenuBar, there is a JMenu labeled Options. Clicking that will allow the user to 
select the Change Escape Distance JMenuItem.

Clicking on the Change Escape Distance JMenuItem will cause a JOptionPane to pop up and 
prompt the user to enter a new escape distance.

On the JOptionPane, the user can type in a numerical value and click the OK button 
to update the escape distance.

The user can also click the Cancel button to not change the escape distance.

In cases where the escape distance entered by the user are not valid, the program will 
reject that input and ask the user to re-enter the escape distance.
