UPDATE:

How to update the escape distance of the fractal.


On the JMenuBar, there is a JMenu labeled Options. Clicking that will allow the user to 
select the Change Escape Distance JMenuItem.

Clicking on the Change Escape Distance JMenuItem will cause a JOptionPane to pop up and 
prompt the user to enter a new escape distance.

On the JOptionPane, the user can type in a numerical value and click the OK button 
to update the escape distance.

The user can also click the Cancel button to not change the escape distance.

In cases where the escape distance entered by the user are not valid, the program will 
reject that input and ask the user to re-enter the escape distance.

To change the escape distance, we take the input given by the user, try to parse it as a double, then perform checks for valid value.
A valid value is a double greater than 0.  We take the double value and pass it to changeED(value) which changes the distance for the current fractal
and updates the fractalpanel with newly generated escape time values.
