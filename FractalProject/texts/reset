RESET:

How to reset the zoom of the fractal.

On the JMenuBar, there is a JMenu labeled Options. Clicking that will allow the user to 
select the Reset JMenuItem.

There is also another Reset button located on the Zoom Board just under the fractal display.

When the user hits the reset buttons, either in the "Zoom Board" or in the options menu, 
the fractal will regenerate with the default values. The default values are stored upon 
original instantiation and are accessed with the reset() function in the Fractal class.
