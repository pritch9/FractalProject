RUN:

How to know if the program is running correctly.


Find Driver.java in the code.UI package and runs it as a Java Application.

A JFrame with a JMenuBar and JPanels should pop up, displaying the Mandelbrot Set Fractal
with rainbow colors along with a Zoom Board below it.

On the JMenuBar there should be 4 JMenus, which are File, Fractals, Colors, and Options
respectively.

Clicking on File will cause the JMenuItems Restart Program and Exit to appear. The program 
will restart with default values when the user selects the Restart Program JMenuItem while 
selecting Exit will terminate the program immediately.

Clicking on Fractals will allow the user to select from 4 JMenuItems, which are Mandelbrot
Set, Julia Set, Burning Ship Set, and Multibrot Set. The display will then update to show 
the respective fractal.

Clicking on Colors will allow the user to select from the colors of Blue, Gray, Rainbow, or 
Green. The display will then update to show the fractal in the designated color.

Clicking on Options will allow the user to change Escape Distance, Max Escape Time, and the 
Color Density. There is also a Reset JMenuItem to allow the user to reset the zoom of the 
fractal. See update.txt and reset.txt for more details.

For Zooming:  When a user clicks and drags from top left to bottom right on the fractal, a 
red box will be drawn as the user moves their mouse. When the user releases the mouse 
button, the fractal will regenerate with the bounds set by the square box.

On the bottom of the GUI, is a zoom menu with 3 buttons:
	- "Zoom Out": which zooms out from the zoomed in point.
	- "Zoom In": which zooms in to either the center of the view, or zooms into a 
				 pre-selected point.
	- "Reset": which stops all animation and returns to the full view of the fractal.
