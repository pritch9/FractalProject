Meeting Minutes for _______________:

    Meeting Attendance: (list all students who were present) [1 minute]
        Put an 'M' next to the name of the student taking minutes
        Put a 'U' next to the name of the student updating user stories

    User stories worked upon but not completed since last meeting [2-4 minutes]
        List each of these stories by name/label
        Significant discussions of ideas or actions to make progress on these stories should be documented in the userStories directory
        Some weeks, including the first week your group meets, this will be blank
    
    Goals for the next meeting [20+ minutes]
        Choose which of the remaining user stories will be worked upon in the coming week.
        Discuss what is needed to complete each of these user stories.
        Large user stories will need to be broken into a number of smaller user stories. For example, each user story in Phase #1 requires a lot of preparatory work AND include multiple potential situations. Different parts of the preparatory work and each possible situation that needs solving can be made into their own, much smaller, user story. Document these changes in your 'user_story' folder.
    
    Schedule for the next week's set of pair programming meetings [3-4 minutes]
        Pair programming sessions should be two hours long (no more, no less)
        Every team member should participate in two sessions each week, with each session including a different team member
        Identify the user story to be worked on in each session
